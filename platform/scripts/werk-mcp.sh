# werk-mcp.sh — drive the 8-step werk flow through the REAL MCP HTTP path, in order,
# the same calls the agents exercise. No rust binaries directly, no hand-rolled verb
# logic — every step is a tools/call against the live chorus-api MCP server
# (http://localhost:$CHORUS_MCP_PORT/mcp). Dies LOUD on the named step at first fail.
#
# Usage:
#   werk-mcp.sh <builder-role> <card> [accepter]
#     builder-role  kade|wren|silas   whose werk is being landed
#     card          card id
#     accepter      jeff|wren  who finalizes (DEC-048); default jeff; must != builder
#
# THE 8-STEP FLOW (per /tmp/werk-value-stream-v2.svg, Jeff's spec 2026-06-03):
#   — werk-demo boundary: prove in the role's slot, never touches main —
#   1 werk-commit   (rebase onto origin/main happens INSIDE commit, #3186)
#   2 werk-push
#   3 chorus_build  (build for the demo test)
#   4 chorus_deploy target=werk + chorus_env_up (stand up the running test instance)
#   — werk-acp boundary: land to prod; prod is a build of MAIN —
#   5 werk-merge    (#3175) resolve OPEN pr by HEAD oid, squash, content-verify
#   6 chorus_build  MUST build from MAIN
#   7 chorus_deploy target=canonical, from MAIN
#   8 werk-accept   X-Chorus-Role=accepter (jeff/wren); role-arg stays the builder
#
# Steps 1-5 run for real. Step 6 HARD-STOPS at the deploy-from-main gap: chorus_build/
# chorus_deploy build from the WERK, and deploying werk-content to canonical IS the
# merged≠live bug — so we REFUSE rather than fake it. Steps 6-8 are the intended flow,
# gated behind the stop until deploy-from-main exists. demo-from-werk (3-4) is correct
# (your slot); prod-from-werk (6-7) is not (it's not main) — that asymmetry is the gate.
#
# MCP: Streamable-HTTP. initialize (capture Mcp-Session-Id) -> notifications/initialized
# -> tools/call. X-Chorus-Role is read per-request, so accept runs as a different role
# over the same session. Responses are SSE-framed (`data: <json>`).
