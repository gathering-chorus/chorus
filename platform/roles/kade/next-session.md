# Next Session — Kade

## Accomplished
- #1995 accepted: /cs skill rewrite, fuseki-sync graph URI fix, check-seeds.sh with write probe
- Triple-quote escaping fix for seed content (Karpathy SMS with emoji + surrogate pairs)
- Test seed isolation — isTestSeed() blocks brief writes and spine events for BDD/probe seeds
- BDD seed cleanup — stripped fake stubs, fixed Fuseki auth in After hook, content-based cleanup
- Deleted nudge.sh — one path (nudge binary), 32+ refs updated across repo + skills + memory

## Open
- 8 BDD failures (policy steps, conversation recall) — pre-existing, not investigated
- 4 undefined BDD steps — missing step definitions
- Jeff frustrated by: not testing what I change, running wrong tests, reporting irrelevant failures as if they matter then dismissing them

## Feedback received
- Nudge tests firing real nudges = test passing, not noise to suppress
- Delete don't deprecate — one path, no wrappers
- Don't report failures unrelated to your change
- "Not my code" is not a thing on a team of three
- Jeff was managing me instead of me managing my work

## Next
- Pull next card from Next queue (#1865 photo thumbnail, smallest first)
- The 8+4 BDD failures need ownership — investigate, fix, or coordinate
