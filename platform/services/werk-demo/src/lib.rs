//! werk-demo — `/demo` proving gate v2 (card #3046).
//!
//! Folds the /demo skill into the werk binary. The ACT is build → deploy → verify,
//! which invokes the shipped verbs werk-build (#3061) + werk-deploy (#3062) rather
//! than re-implementing them; demo gates that act with validate → AC-preflight →
//! gate-chain → DEC-048 non-builder-confirm. Record = logs (card+trace jsonl, Loki
//! ingests) + gh per-card status `chorus/demo/<card>`; NO evidence token.
//!
//! Self-contained: std only + a direct libc `flock` extern; git / cards / werk-build
//! / werk-deploy as subprocesses. Zero dependency on any other chorus code (ADR-032).
//!
//! INCREMENT 1 (#3046): primitives + the act-spine + the demo-skill gates that are
//! pure-checkable (validate, AC-preflight, gate-chain presence, DEC-048). The deeper
//! fold — the bash smoke gates' internals + the 4 demo_* hooks (preflight/provenance/
//! show/trace) — is the NAMED next increment, ported against an explicit check-map so
//! nothing drops silently (the card's central caution).
